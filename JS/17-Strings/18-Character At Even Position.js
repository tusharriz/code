// Character At Even Position 

`You are given a string whose size is stored in a variable with the
name N , stored in a variable with the name str
You have to print all the characters in the string, which are prese
nt at even indexes
For example, consider the string stored in str = "nrupul" , and t
he value stored in N = 6 , then the output will be
n
u
u
The characters stored at odd positions are n - index 0 , u - ind
ex 2 , l - index 4 , hence they are printed, each character on a
new line
Note : The indexing in the string starts from 0

Sample Input 1 ï„§
6
ankush
Sample Output 1
a
k
s`

let str = "ankush";

for(let i=0; i<=str.length-1; i++){
    if(i%2==0){
        console.log(str[i]);
    }
}

// a
// k
// s
