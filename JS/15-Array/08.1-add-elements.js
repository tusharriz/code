//Add Element;
//With the help of "PUSH" method you can easily add the element at the "END" of an array;

let names = ["Om","Hari","Ram","Prasad","Krishna"];
console.log(names); 
console.log(names.length); //5

names.push("Hari");
console.log(names);
console.log(names.length); // intially the length was 5, but after add one more element to it the lenght is 6.
