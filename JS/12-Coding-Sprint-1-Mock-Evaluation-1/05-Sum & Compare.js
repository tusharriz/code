// Sum & Compare 

`You are given five numbers, stored in the variables with the following name
one, two, three, four, five
You have to declare another variable sum1 , such that sum1 = one + two + three
Also, you have to declare another variable sum2 , such that sum2 = four + five
Finally, you have to print the output of the following operation
sum1 > sum2 (This operation prints true, if sum1 is greater than sum2, else it prints false)

Sample Input 1 ï„§
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output 1
false
`

let one = 1;
let two = 2;
let three = 3;
let four = 4;
let five = 5;

let sum1 = one + two + three;
let sum2 = four + five;

if(sum1 > sum2){
    console.log(true);
}else{
    console.log(false); 
}

// false
