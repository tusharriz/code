// write a function to perform multiplication and use return statement

function multiplication(a,b){
    return a*b;
}

console.log(multiplication(5,10)) // 50

// or

let result = multiplication(5,10);
console.log(result) ; // 50

//1-> Return is going to give back the answer to the calling statement.

//2-> As soon as compiler encounters a return statemnet, it will take the answer and go out of the function
