`
You are given two numbers stored in variables with the name N and M respectively
You have to find the value of sum , such that sum = N^7 + M^7
For example, consider the value stored in N = 2 , and M = 3
Therefore, N^7 = 2*2*2*2*2*2*2 = 128 , and M^7 = 3*3*3*3*3*3*3 = 2187
Therefore, sum = 128 + 2187 = 2315 , which is the required answer

Sample Input 1 ï„§
2 3
Sample Output 1
2315`

let n = 2;
let m = 3;
let sum = n**7 + m**7;
console.log(sum); // 2315
