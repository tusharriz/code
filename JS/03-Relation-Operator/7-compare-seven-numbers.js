`You are given seven numbers, stored in the variable with the following names
a,b,c,d,e,f,g

You have to declare two variables, sum1 and sum2 , such that sum1 = (a + b) * c and sum2 = (d + e + f + g)

Print the output of the following operation
sum1 > sum2`

let a = 1; b = 2; c = 3; d = 4; e = 5; f = 6; g = 7;

let sum1 = (a + b) * c;
let sum2 = (d + e + f + g);

console.log(sum1 > sum2); //false
