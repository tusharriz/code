// Operation on Numbers I 

`You are given a number stored in a variable with the name N
You have to do the following operations on the number stored in a variable with the name N
1. Multiply the number with 10
2. Add 2 to the number
3. Subtract 11 from the number
Print the result obtained after the three operations
For example, consider the value stored in N = 5 . So, the result of the 3 operations with the following numbers
Step 1 -> 5*10 = 50
Step 2 -> 50 + 2 = 52
Step 3 -> 52 - 11 = 41
Therefore, the final output of the number is 41

Sample Input 1 ï„§
5
Sample Output 1
41`

let n = 5;

n = n * 10;
n = n + 2;
n = n - 11;

console.log(n);

// 41
