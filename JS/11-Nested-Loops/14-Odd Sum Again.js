// Odd Sum Again

`You are given a number stored in a variable with the name N

You have to print N lines such that on each line you find the sum of all odd numbers in the range of [1,i] , where i represents all the numbers in the range of [1,N]

For example, consider the value stored in N = 3

Then, first we find the sum of all even numbers, in the range of [1,1], which comes out to be 1, as there is one odd number (1) in the range

Then, we find the sum of all even numbers, in the range of [1,2],which comes out to be 1, as there is only 1 odd number (1). Hence, the sum becomes 1

Finally, we find the sum of all even numbers in the range of [1,3],which comes out to be 4, as there are two odd numbers (1,3) in the given range. Hence, the sum becomes 4

Therefore, the final output becomes
1

4
