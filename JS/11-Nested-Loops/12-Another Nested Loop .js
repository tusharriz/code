// Another Nested Loop 

`You are given a number stored in a variable with the name num
Print num lines such that there are numbers from 1 to i , such that on
each line you print only one number. Also, i represents all the number
s from 1 to num
For example, consider the value stored in num = 5
Therefore, the required output will be
